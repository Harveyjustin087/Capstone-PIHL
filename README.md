# Capstone-Project
This repository is for the Conestoga College Capstone Project for 2022. This application was designed for the Paris Industrial Hockey Leagure (PIHL).
This application was created with ASP.NET Core 5 and uses a SQL Server database. The application manages game score and statistics through out the
league from players and teams. The hosted site can be reached through http://3.136.202.91/ and requires login credentials of a scorekeeper or a league
adminstrator. Currently the site owner is in the process of selecting a domain name. Feel free to use the video included to see how the application operates.
